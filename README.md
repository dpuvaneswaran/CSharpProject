SCRUM FRAMEWORK:
The Scrum Framework was utilised for this project due to its reliability to accomodate to adaptability.

PRODUCT BACKLOG:
The very first steps of the project, was to gather necessary informations to be able to build a suitable application based on users requests. I had to create User Stories to gather ideas of functionalities that can be implemented within the application to make it user friendly. Here below are some examples of User Stories:

- As a user I want to be able to save my scores to be the best
- As a user I want to be able to change the colour of my snake
- As a user I want to be able to quit if I donâ€™t want to carry on with the game.
- As a user I want to be able to name my character
- As a user I want to be able to view Highscores to beat
- As a user I want some sound playing while playing the game
- As a user I want to be able to see instructions of the game
- As a user I want to be see an appealing interface
- As a user I want to be able to track my score while playing the game

Based on these requests I had to design and visualise a picture in my head how the Application would look.

SPRINT 1:
It was necessary that I had set up everything at the start so i dont get confused and mixed around tasks such as Version Control. During the first sprint of the project I designed all the GUI for all the pages such as the LOGIN FORM, REGISTRATION, MAIN MENU, INSTRUCTIONS PAGE, HIGHSCORES. I also started to build the base code of my Tic Tac Toe Game for the game. Also, i created all the tables such as the Users and Highscores Table to be stored in the database. Managed to some of the pages together in sprint 1 but had difficulties in connecting to the database.

SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE 1:
I was happy that I managed to make all the foundation that was necessary for the application to be up and people were able to have a glance of how the product would look at the end of project. On the other hand i still had a lot of work to do such as all the functionalities to be able to work and also have the game finished by the end of the week and also write Testcases for those codes.
