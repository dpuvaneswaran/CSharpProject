# CSharpProject
A short project made within 5 days using the Scrum framework
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Project Goal:
Make a fully functionable application where the user will be able to login and play tic tac toe game. Being able to view highscores retrieved from SQL database. The goal was achieve to meet the lowest viable product. The application was built within a tightframe of 4 days of planning and development.

SCRUM FRAMEWORK:
The Scrum Framework was utilised for this project due to its reliability to accomodate to adaptability.

PRODUCT BACKLOG:
The very first steps of the project, was to gather necessary informations to be able to build a suitable application based on users requests. I had to create User Stories to gather ideas of functionalities that can be implemented within the application to make it user friendly. Here below are some examples of User Stories:

- As a user I want to be able to save my scores to be the best
- As a user I want to be able to change the colour of my snake
- As a user I want to be able to quit if I donâ€™t want to carry on with the game.
- As a user I want to be able to name my character
- As a user I want to be able to view Highscores to beat
- As a user I want some sound playing while playing the game
- As a user I want to be able to see instructions of the game
- As a user I want to be see an appealing interface
- As a user I want to be able to track my score while playing the game

Based on these requests I had to design and visualise a picture in my head how the Application would look.

SPRINT 1:

It was necessary that I had set up everything at the start so i dont get confused and mixed around tasks such as Version Control. During the first sprint of the project I designed all the GUI for all the pages such as the LOGIN FORM, REGISTRATION, MAIN MENU, INSTRUCTIONS PAGE, HIGHSCORES. I also started to build the base code of my Tic Tac Toe Game for the game. Also, i created all the tables such as the Users and Highscores Table to be stored in the database. Managed to some of the pages together in sprint 1 but had difficulties in connecting to the database. The blockers I came accross during the first sprint, was to get everything up and running and the biggest trouble was to query from Database. Improvements were important, such as making the functionalities work to its full potential as most of my buttons were not linked to each windows also to be able to retrieve informations from database to be able to Login in to the database and take to the next page.

SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE 1:

I managed to make all the foundation that was necessary for the application in the first sprint to be up and people were able to have a glance of how the product would look at the end of project. On the other hand i still had a lot of work to do such as all the functionalities to be able to work and also have the game finished by the end of the week and also write Testcases for those codes.

SPRINT 2:

Sprint 2 was very important in the major development of the prototype as the deadline was approaching nearby. The main focus during this sprint was to make sure that all buttons works as they were meant to be doing. I was having difficulties uploading my codes to version control during to errors. During this sprint, I managed to connect to the database that I created called "Project" and query from it. The trouble that was occuring often during this sprint, was the lack of time which resulted in narrowing down the scope of the project. By the end Sprint 2, I had a working product which has a Login function, Highscores system were the user was able to retrieve highscores which were queried from the sql database, Instructions page and also most importantly where the user can play the game of TICTACTOE. I had issues with the game having minor errors in the logic of the game. Due to the time restriction, i couldnt make a register page.

SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE 2:

During this project, I gained a variety of experience linking SQL and C# together using Entity Framework. I have learned how to use TimeBoxing techniques to be able to finish tasks in a quicker period of time and priotising small tasks to be done first before hitting the big areas of the project which helped me produced a working product. Things that i could have done better, I could have made the application have better features and functionality. I would want to upskill my programming level to be able to produce better products which would come to experience.
